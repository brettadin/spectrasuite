# HANDOFF 1.0.0l — Archive fetchers online

## 1) Summary of This Run
- Delivered operational MAST and SDSS adapters that return real spectroscopic product metadata with wavelength bounds, provenance, and download links.
- Added regression suites with synthetic astroquery stubs so CI can validate the normalisation logic without network access.
- Updated atlas/brains/patch notes/handoff plus version metadata to advertise `1.0.0l` / `1.0.0.dev12`.

## 2) Current State of the Project
- **Working tabs:** Overlay (axis + transform provenance captions, line overlays, export), Differential, Star Hub (SIMBAD resolver + new archive metadata), Line Atlas, Docs.
- **Data ingestion:** ASCII/FITS loaders cover wavelength, wavenumber, frequency, and energy axes with provenance logging.
- **Fetchers:** SIMBAD resolver with fixture fallback; MAST + SDSS adapters return spectroscopic `Product` entries with coverage/resolution estimates and canonical links.
- **Docs & comms:** Atlas fetcher overview, patch notes, brains journal, and this handoff document the archive work.

## 3) Next Steps (Prioritized)
1. Thread the new `Product` outputs into the Star Hub UI so analysts can add archive spectra directly to overlays.
2. Capture mission-specific citations/DOIs when archives expose them and bubble attribution into manifests.
3. Evaluate caching / retry strategies for archive calls to improve resilience when network access is intermittent.

## 4) Decisions & Rationale
- Normalised MAST wavelength bounds assuming metre inputs when values are <1e-2, which covers published catalogue scales without double-counting nm ranges.
- Declared SDSS flux units explicitly (`1e-17 erg s^-1 cm^-2 Å^-1`) while leaving DOI fields empty pending authoritative identifiers.
- Closed extra FITS handles returned by astroquery to avoid descriptor leaks in long-lived sessions.

## 6) Quick Start for the Next AI
- Install deps / smoke: `python -m pip install -e .`, `PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q`.
- Static checks: `ruff check .`, `black --check .`, `mypy .`.
- Verifiers: `python tools/verifiers/Verify-Atlas.py`, `Verify-PatchNotes.py`, `Verify-Brains.py`, `Verify-Handoff.py`, `PYTHONPATH=. python tools/verifiers/Verify-UI-Contract.py`.
- Manual QA: invoke the new fetchers (MAST search by RA/Dec, SDSS by SpecObjID) and confirm wavelength coverage/resolution metadata look plausible with working download links.
