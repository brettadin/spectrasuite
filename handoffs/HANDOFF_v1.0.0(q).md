# HANDOFF 1.0.0q â€” Docs tab refresh

## 1) Summary of This Run
- Fixed the Docs tab so it discovers Markdown recursively, parses YAML front matter, and exposes a navigation column with summaries.
- Authored new user-facing documentation: refreshed overview, detailed user guide, and citation references tailored to current data providers.
- Bumped release metadata to `1.0.0q`/`1.0.0.dev16` and captured implementation details plus validation steps in project notes.

## 2) Current State of the Project
- **Working tabs:** Overlay, Differential, Star Hub, Similarity, and Docs (now fully populated from `docs/static/`).
- **Documentation system:** Markdown pages can declare `title`, `group`, `order`, and `summary` to influence navigation; source paths render in the UI for provenance.
- **Ingestion & analysis:** Existing ingestion, overlay, differential, similarity, and export functionality remain intact (verified via regression suite).
- **Comms artifacts:** Patch notes, brains log, handoff, and implementation notes updated for this iteration.

## 3) Next Steps (Prioritized)
1. Extend the Docs tab UI with collapsible group headers or search once the document set grows beyond a handful of pages.
2. Surface provider error messaging and one-click ingestion polish in Star Hub (still rough in edge cases).
3. Begin planning manifest replay automation now that documentation explains bundle contents.

## 4) Decisions & Rationale
- Leveraged YAML front matter to avoid extra config files while keeping docs maintainable by humans.
- Presented navigation via a simple radio selector to maintain Streamlit compatibility without adding custom components.
- Included document source captions in the UI so analysts can trace Markdown provenance quickly.

## 5) References
- Patch notes: `PATCH_NOTES/PATCH_NOTES_v1.0.0(q).md`
- Brains log: `brains/v1.0.0q__assistant__docs_tab_refresh.md`
- Implementation notes: `IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md`

## 6) Quick Start for the Next AI
- Smoke/tests: `python -m pip install -e .`, `PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q`.
- Static checks: `ruff check app/ui/docs.py`, `black --check app/ui/docs.py`, `mypy app/ui/docs.py`.
- Verifiers: `python tools/verifiers/Verify-Atlas.py`, `Verify-PatchNotes.py`, `Verify-Brains.py`, `Verify-Handoff.py`, `PYTHONPATH=. python tools/verifiers/Verify-UI-Contract.py`.
- Manual QA: Launch Streamlit, open Docs tab, confirm navigation shows Overview, User Guide, Citations with summaries and source captions; verify Markdown updates appear on refresh.
