# HANDOFF 1.0.0n â€” Archive metadata resilience

## 1) Summary of This Run
- Hardened archive product ingestion so spectra without pre-populated canonical metadata no longer crash
  when merging archive annotations.
- Added regression coverage around the metadata merge guard and bumped version metadata to `1.0.0n` /
  `1.0.0.dev14`.

## 2) Current State of the Project
- **Working tabs:** Overlay, Differential, Star Hub, Docs.
- **Data ingestion:** ASCII/FITS loaders canonicalise to vacuum nm with provenance; archive downloads feed
  through `ingest_product` with resilient metadata merging.
- **Fetchers:** SIMBAD resolver, MAST region search, SDSS helpers, archive ingestion utility.
- **Docs & comms:** Patch notes / brains / version metadata updated for this resilience fix.

## 3) Next Steps (Prioritized)
1. Capture archive-specific citation/DOI metadata where available and surface it in exports.
2. Investigate caching or retry strategies for large archive downloads to keep the UI responsive.
3. Extend export manifests to embed archive download URIs for deterministic replay.

## 4) Decisions & Rationale
- When metadata is missing on the canonical spectrum, initialise an empty `TraceMetadata` so archive
  details can be merged without losing provenance expectations.
- Treat absent `source_hash` values as a non-blocking case when replacing placeholder product IDs.
- Codified the guard with a regression test to keep ingestion robust as fetchers evolve.

## 6) Quick Start for the Next AI
- Install deps / smoke: `python -m pip install -e .`, `PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q`.
- Static checks: `ruff check .`, `black --check .`, `mypy .`.
- Verifiers: `python tools/verifiers/Verify-Atlas.py`, `Verify-PatchNotes.py`, `Verify-Brains.py`,
  `Verify-Handoff.py`, `PYTHONPATH=. python tools/verifiers/Verify-UI-Contract.py`.
- Manual QA: Resolve a target via SIMBAD, fetch an archive spectrum, ingest it, and confirm provenance +
  metadata render correctly in the overlay. Export the session to ensure archive ingests participate in
  the manifest.
