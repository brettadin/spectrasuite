# HANDOFF 0.1.0d — ASCII ingestion resilience
## 1) Summary of This Run
- Normalised ASCII header tokens so wavelength/flux columns are detected even when exports use camel
  case, embedded punctuation, or accented characters.
- Expanded metadata alias detection (Target/Object/Instrument/Telescope/Observer) and filtered null-like
  values to improve provenance and automatic trace labelling.
- Added regression coverage for messy header combinations and updated docs/version artifacts for 0.1.0d.

## 2) Current State of the Project
- **Working tabs:** Overlay (ASCII+FITS with resilient header parsing), Differential, Star Hub (SIMBAD
  resolver with fixtures), Docs.
- **Known gaps:** Archive fetchers (MAST/SDSS) still stubbed; replay CLI/UI reconstruction pending;
  docs tab remains a high-level overview.
- **Performance:** Adequate for sample traces; ASCII ingest now spends negligible extra time on
  canonicalisation.
- **Debt:** Archive adapters, replay automation, ingest uncertainty alias expansion, accessibility
  review for Docs tab.

## 3) Next Steps (Prioritized)
1) Implement archive fetchers (`server/fetchers/mast.py`, `server/fetchers/sdss.py`) with fixture-backed
   tests to exercise the broadened metadata paths.
2) Build the export replay CLI/UI reconstruction tooling, ensuring provenance reflects the new metadata
   derivations.
3) Extend uncertainty alias coverage (e.g. `ErrFlux`, `FluxErr`) and unit normalisation for common flux
   conventions (erg/s/cm²/Å, Jy).

## 4) Decisions & Rationale
- Chose canonical slug tokenisation to unify header parsing instead of ad-hoc alias growth, improving
  determinism and testability.
- Treated "Object" fields as fallback targets to keep UI labelling stable when "Target" is absent while
  still recording the original column in metadata extras.
- Filtered null-like strings before writing metadata to prevent "nan" badges resurfacing in the UI or
  provenance feeds.

## 6) Quick Start for the Next AI
- Install: `pip install -e .[dev]`
- Run app: `streamlit run app/app_patched.py`
- Quality gates: `ruff check .`, `black --check .`, `mypy .`, `python -m pytest`, then
  `python tools/verifiers/Verify-*.py`
- Sample data: ASCII (`data/examples/example_spectrum.csv`, messy header strings in tests), single-HDU
  FITS (`data/examples/example_spectrum.fits`); tests synthesize SDSS-like fixtures.
