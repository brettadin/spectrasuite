# HANDOFF 0.1.0a — Bootstrap overlay + ingest
## 1) Summary of This Run
- Established the Streamlit shell with Overlay, Differential, Star Hub, and Docs tabs plus sidebar controls and export button.
- Implemented ASCII ingestion pipeline with canonical conversion, provenance logging, and dedupe ledger; added SIMBAD resolver fallback and Fe I line overlays.
- Added manifest export v2 (manifest JSON, trace CSVs, optional PNG) alongside core math utilities (unit transforms, resolution matching, differential ops).
- Seeded atlas/docs/brains/patch notes/handoff artifacts and verification scripts; configured CI workflow and dependency metadata.

## 2) Current State of the Project
- Working tabs: Overlay (upload & plotting with unit toggles + line overlays), Differential (A−B / A/B), Star Hub (SIMBAD resolver w/ fallback), Docs (markdown rendering).
- Known gaps: FITS ingestion, archive fetchers (MAST/SDSS), advanced overlays (resolution broadening), replay UI, richer docs/content.
- Performance: Plotly Scattergl handles demo traces smoothly; resolution matching uses Gaussian blur; no async offloading yet.
- Debt: fetcher stubs, replay script, more rigorous provenance UI, expanded accessibility checks.

## 3) Next Steps (Prioritized)
1) Implement FITS ingestion (`server/ingest/fits_loader.py`) and extend canonicalisation tests; acceptance: FITS sample loads with metadata + provenance.
2) Flesh out Star Hub provider matrix (MAST/SDSS adapters) with offline fixtures; acceptance: pytest integration passes with sample product metadata.
3) Build replay CLI/stub to reconstruct session from manifest; acceptance: CLI reproduces exported traces/overlays.

## 4) Decisions & Rationale
- Used local fixtures for SIMBAD and NIST data to keep tests deterministic while allowing online resolution when available.
- Chose Plotly for fast WebGL overlay plotting with straightforward PNG export via Kaleido.
- Logged provenance as structured events attached to `CanonicalSpectrum` to support manifest replay and audit trail.

## 6) Quick Start for the Next AI
- Setup: `pip install -e .[dev]`; run app with `streamlit run app/app_patched.py`.
- Tests/lint: `ruff check . --fix`, `black .`, `mypy .`, `pytest`, plus `python tools/verifiers/Verify-*.py` as in CI.
- No API keys needed; SIMBAD resolver works offline via fixture; data samples in `/data/examples`.
