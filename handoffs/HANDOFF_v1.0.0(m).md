# HANDOFF 1.0.0m â€” Star Hub ingestion

## 1) Summary of This Run
- Connected Star Hub to the archive fetchers so analysts can resolve a target, query MAST, pull SDSS
  spectra, and add the downloads straight into the overlay with provenance intact.
- Added an archive ingestion helper that normalises FITS/ASCII payloads, merges catalog metadata, and
  records a `fetch_archive_product` provenance event.
- Documented the new workflow in the atlas/docs and advanced version metadata to `1.0.0m` /
  `1.0.0.dev13`.

## 2) Current State of the Project
- **Working tabs:** Overlay (uploads + archive ingests with provenance captions), Differential, Star
  Hub (SIMBAD resolve + MAST/SDSS wiring), Docs.
- **Data ingestion:** ASCII/FITS loaders canonicalise to vacuum nm with provenance; archive downloads
  share the same pipeline via `ingest_product`.
- **Fetchers:** SIMBAD resolver (with fixture), MAST region search, SDSS SpecObjID/plate helpers, and
  the new ingestion utility.
- **Docs & comms:** Fetcher overview and docs overview updated; patch notes / brains / handoff reflect
  the archive integration.

## 3) Next Steps (Prioritized)
1. Capture archive-specific citation/DOI metadata where available and surface it in exports.
2. Investigate caching or retry strategies for large archive downloads to keep the UI responsive.
3. Extend export manifests to embed archive download URIs for deterministic replay.

## 4) Decisions & Rationale
- Preferred FITS ingestion with an ASCII fallback to cover common archive formats without bespoke
  adapters per mission.
- Only overwrite metadata fields that are empty after canonicalisation so authoritative FITS headers
  remain untouched.
- Deduplicated SDSS fetch results inside Star Hub to keep the trace manager from accumulating duplicates.

## 6) Quick Start for the Next AI
- Install deps / smoke: `python -m pip install -e .`, `PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q`.
- Static checks: `ruff check .`, `black --check .`, `mypy .`.
- Verifiers: `python tools/verifiers/Verify-Atlas.py`, `Verify-PatchNotes.py`, `Verify-Brains.py`,
  `Verify-Handoff.py`, `PYTHONPATH=. python tools/verifiers/Verify-UI-Contract.py`.
- Manual QA: Resolve a target via SIMBAD, run a MAST search, ingest at least one SDSS spectrum, and
  confirm provenance + axis captions appear correctly in the overlay. Export the session to ensure
  archive ingests participate in the manifest.
