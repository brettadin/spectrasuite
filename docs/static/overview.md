# Spectra App Documentation

Spectra App provides a reproducible environment for ingesting spectra, comparing archival data,
and exporting manifests that replay the current view. The current build includes:

- Overlay, Differential, Star Hub, and Docs tabs within the Streamlit interface.
- ASCII **and FITS** ingestion with canonical wavelength conversion, provenance logging, and
  duplicate detection.
- Export bundles (manifest v2, per-trace CSVs, optional PNG) with a replay stub that
  reconstructs visible traces.
- Fe I line overlays with scaling controls plus an offline SIMBAD resolver fixture.
- Frequency- and energy-based uploads (Hzâ€“PHz, eV/keV/MeV) auto-convert to the wavelength baseline
  during ingest, with provenance capturing the detected axis family.

Upcoming documentation work will expand this section with end-to-end usage guidance, data-source
citation details, legal notices, and troubleshooting tips.
