# v0.1.0a — Initial bootstrap

## Context
- Kickoff run implementing the Spectra App skeleton and first functional slice.
- Established version `0.1.0a` aligned across configuration and continuity artifacts.

## Changes
- `app/ui/*`, `app/state/session.py`: created Streamlit UI with overlay, differential, star hub, and docs tabs; implemented session state, unit toggles, and export button.
- `server/ingest/*`, `server/math/*`, `server/overlays/lines.py`, `server/fetchers/resolver_simbad.py`, `server/export/manifest.py`: implemented ASCII ingestion, canonicalisation, transforms, line overlays, SIMBAD resolver, resolution matching, differential engine, and manifest export.
- `data/examples/*`: added sample spectrum, SIMBAD fixture, and line list for demonstrations/tests.
- `tools/verifiers/*`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `pyproject.toml`: added verification scripts, CI workflow, dependency metadata, and lint/type settings.
- `atlas/*`, `docs/static/overview.md`, `README.md`: documented architecture, UI contract, data model, and usage instructions.

## Decisions
- Adopted local fixtures for resolver/line data to keep tests network-independent while optionally hitting SIMBAD.
- Logged provenance through `ProvenanceEvent` objects carried by canonical spectra to align with export manifest requirements.
- Export bundle includes manifest, per-trace CSVs, and optional PNG (via Plotly/Kaleido) to meet reproducibility criteria.
- Added per-file ruff ignores for asserts in tests rather than disabling security checks globally.

## Tests & Evidence
- `ruff check . --fix` (`c5164c`)
- `black .` (`d16424`)
- `mypy .` (`5ec638`)
- `pytest` (`4e7079`)

## Regressions Prevented
- Unit conversions and air↔vacuum round trips validated to avoid future drift.
- ASCII ingest header parsing hardened against varied labels to prevent silent ingestion failures.
- Resolver fallback ensures deterministic aliases when SIMBAD omits expected names.

## Follow-ups
- Implement FITS ingestion and additional archive adapters (MAST, SDSS) with offline test fixtures.
- Expand overlay controls (LOD decimation, continuum tools) and integrate session replay script.
- Flesh out Docs tab with detailed user guidance and source attributions.

## Checklist
- [x] Atlas updated
