# v1.0.0q â€” Docs tab refresh

## Context
- Previous builds shipped a Docs tab stub that only displayed `docs/static/*.md` at the repository root of the `app` package, leaving the UI empty in production deployments.
- The roadmap called for surfacing user guides and citation material inside the app so analysts can reference workflows without leaving the session.

## Changes
- Repointed `_DOCS_DIR` to the project-level `docs/static/` directory and implemented recursive Markdown discovery with YAML front-matter parsing.
- Added navigation UI (radio selector + summaries + source captions) so users can switch between documents quickly while preserving provenance.
- Authored new documentation pages: refreshed overview (with architecture highlights), user guide walkthrough, and citations list covering NIST, Astropy, Specutils, and archive providers.
- Recorded implementation details, validation plan, and external references in `IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md` alongside new patch/handoff artifacts.

## Decisions
- Used YAML front matter to keep metadata colocated with each Markdown document instead of maintaining a separate registry file.
- Collapsed navigation into Streamlit-native components to avoid introducing third-party UI dependencies.
- Defaulted empty documents to a placeholder message so the UI fails gracefully if a file lacks content.

## Tests & Evidence
- `ruff check app/ui/docs.py`
- `black --check app/ui/docs.py`
- `mypy app/ui/docs.py`
- `PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q`
- `python tools/verifiers/Verify-Atlas.py`
- `python tools/verifiers/Verify-PatchNotes.py`
- `python tools/verifiers/Verify-Brains.py`
- `python tools/verifiers/Verify-Handoff.py`
- `PYTHONPATH=. python tools/verifiers/Verify-UI-Contract.py`

## Regressions Prevented
- Ensures documentation renders reliably across environments by resolving the correct directory and handling missing metadata.
- Guards against navigation dead-ends when additional docs are added because front matter drives ordering and grouping.

## Follow-ups
- Enhance navigation with grouped headers or search as the document set grows.
- Embed quick links to external archives directly inside docs once API keys and usage constraints are documented.
- Consider mirroring docs into the export bundle for fully offline reference.
